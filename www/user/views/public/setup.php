<h1>You forgot to configure inKSpot</h1>
<p>
	While it is totally true that inKSpot is fast and easy to use, there is
	some configuration required.  You need to set up a little bit of
	information so that users know where to get help, additional information,
	and so that inKSpot knows how to present itself.
</p>
<h2>Editing the inKSpot Configuration</h2>
<p>
	The inKSpot configuration requires you to set at least three parameters.

		<code>information_email</code>

</ol>
